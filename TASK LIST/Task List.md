# Full-Stack Internship Tasks

These are the 7 tasks that were performed and contributed to during the full-stack internship:

## Task 1: HTML Forms and Node.js Server Setup
- Created HTML forms for user interaction.
- Set up a Node.js server using Express framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Implemented server-side rendering using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to dynamically generate HTML content based on data.

## Task 2: Inline Styles and Server-Side Validation
- Developed inline styles for basic interface styling and user interaction within HTML elements.
- Implemented server-side validation to ensure data integrity and security.
- Extended HTML forms to include more complex input elements and user interactions.
- Utilized client-side JavaScript for immediate feedback and validation of user inputs before submitting data to the server.

## Task 3: Responsive Chatbot Experience
- Designed and implemented a fully responsive single webpage for a chatbot interface.
- Applied advanced CSS techniques, such as media queries and flexbox/grid layouts, to ensure responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

## Task 4: Enhanced Form Validation and Client-Side Routing
- Improved form validation by implementing complex rules, such as password strength requirements and custom validation logic.
- Leveraged DOM manipulation to dynamically update the user interface based on user interactions without full page reloads.
- Implemented client-side routing using frameworks like React Router to enable smoother navigation and user experience within a single-page application.

## Task 5: API Integration with React, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js
- Developed RESTful API endpoints using Node.js and Express to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Integrated MongoDB as a NoSQL database to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- Implemented front-end interactions using React components to consume API endpoints and display data dynamically on the user interface.

## Task 6: Database Integration and User Authentication
- Integrated MongoDB database into the application stack for persistent data storage.
- Implemented user authentication and authorization mechanisms on the server-side using middleware and authentication libraries.
- Ensured secure handling of user credentials and access control to protected resources.

## Task 7: Advanced API Usage and External API Integration
- Explored OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication and authorization.
- Integrated third-party authentication providers like Auth0 to enable seamless login/logout functionality using external APIs.
- Utilized external APIs (e.g., Google Sign-In) to enhance user experience and access additional features within the application.
